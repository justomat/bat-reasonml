# bat-reasonml

reasonml syntax for 
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/#adding-new-syntaxes--language-definitions), 
[delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#configuration), or 
[magit](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#using-delta-with-magit).

git integration in emacs/vim is great and better than other editor. but I still miss IDEs/Jetbrains level features like:
- [x] syntax-highlighting
- [ ] syntax/AST aware diff
- [ ] autoresolve/assist merge conflicts
- [ ] interactive rebase UX
  - drag-n-drop rearrange commit
  - edit commit content/message
  - inspect commit
    - list edited files
    - view tree at commit
